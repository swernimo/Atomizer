This project is based on the [Grove Atomizer](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Water-Atomization-v1-0.html). I've removed the enable flag, changed the power to be USB so you don't need an arduino to run it. Also, I've upsized the capacitors and resisitors to something that I can more easily solder by hand. For more information about the Grove Atomizer see their [wiki page](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Water_Atomization/). Below is the parts list I used when creating my atomizer. I had a hard time finding the same parts as Grove so I had to change a few things.

C1 -> 10 uF 

C2 -> 100 uF 

C3 -> 10 uF 

C4 -> 10 nF 

C5 -> 100 pF 

C6 -> 100 nF 

C7 -> 1 nF 

D1 -> 1N5819 

J1 -> USB Port 

J2 -> 2 Pin Shrouded 

J3, J4 -> 2 Pin Header 

L1 -> 47 uH 

L2 -> 330 uH 

Q1 -> N Channel MOSFET 

R1 -> 10 kOhm (1206) 

R2 -> 220 kOhm (1206) 

R3 -> 2.2 kOhm (1206) 

R4, R5 -> 24 Ohm (1206) 

R6 -> 10 kOhm (1206) 

R7 -> 20 kOhm (1206) 

R8 -> 51 kOhm (1206) 

R9 -> 10 Ohm (1206) 

U1 -> NE 555 (TSSOP-8) 

U2 -> ETA1617 (SOT-23-6)
